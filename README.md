## Journey
### 2016 : First job, first love _at Agoda.com_

I started my exciting journey at a leading technology company as a digital marketing analyst, focusing on online advertising and optimization. I quickly became an expert in Facebook Ads, Google Ads, Google Analytics, and Appsflyer. Within 2 year, I was promoted twice. My focus shifted to ad measurement, where I analyzed the effectiveness of display ads and leveraged insights to scale ad spend effectively. I initiated a healthy work-life-balance, enjoyed running and playing badminton after office hours.

<br>

### 2019 : First time leading the team
I drove significant growth by scaling digital marketing channels and reducing costs. I was deeply involved in collaborative projects between business and product teams. Expanding beyond the team's scope, I consulted a subsidiary in launching digital ads, conducted detailed business research for a new loyalty program. I enjoyed going for a boxing class after work.
<br>
<br>

### 2020 : Moving from ROI to Margin and Revenue
Transition from advertising to a pricing team, from traffic optimization to optimizing profit margin, it's a big step! With exposure to merchandising, including room rates and pricing, I analyzed large datasets and developed many business cases, generating incremental revenue and creating business impact beyond a pricing scope. On the weekend during covid time, I started my small Kimchi business, running for both operation and marketing. 
<br>
<br>

### 2022 : Ecommerce - GMV and CIR Era _at NocNoc.com_
My journey took me to a growing home and living e-commerce startup, where I leveraged business and analytics expertise to provide strategic insights for key decisions. I led initiatives that drove sales, built fundamental of the business and helped bring peopleâ€™s dreams to life. Outside of work, I enjoyed exploring food and coffee places and practicing golf.
<br>
<br>

### 2024 : What's next?
Seeking a challenging role in a dynamic organization to leverage my analytical thinking, design and technical proficiency, marketing expertise, project management and team leadership skills. Passionate about innovation and committed to driving business growth and operational excellence.
