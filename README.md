## Journey
### 2016 : First job, first love at OTA (Agoda.com)
I began my journey as an analyst working on display advertising and optimization and become an expert on Facebook Ads, Google Ads, Google Analytics and Appsflyer.
It was the most exciting time to work on many impactful projects in a technology leading company. Promoted to be specialist in a year and senior specialist in the following year, my focus shifted to ads measurement to understand effectiveness of display ads and leveraged this insight to scale the ads spend.

### 2019 : First time leading the team
I had an opportunity to coach and mentor analysts and continued to scale the channel and optimized cost as a team.
