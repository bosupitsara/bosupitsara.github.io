## Journey

I started my exciting journey at a leading technology company as an analyst, focusing on online advertising and optimization. I quickly became an expert in Facebook Ads, Google Ads, Google Analytics, and Appsflyer. Within 2 year, I was promoted twice. My focus shifted to ad measurement, where I analyzed the effectiveness of display ads and leveraged insights to scale ad spend effectively.
