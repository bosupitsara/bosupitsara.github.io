            <h2>Welcome to my career journey</h2>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>2016: Where It All Began – Digital Marketing & Data-Driven Growth</h3>
                <p>I started my career at a leading technology company as a Digital Marketing Analyst, specializing in online advertising and optimization. I quickly became proficient in Facebook Ads, Google Ads, Google Analytics, and Appsflyer. Within two years, I earned two promotions, shifting my focus to ad measurement—analyzing display ad effectiveness and leveraging insights to scale ad spend efficiently. During this time, I also embraced a healthy work-life balance, enjoying running and badminton after office hours.</p>

            <div class="card">
                <h3>2019: Stepping into Leadership</h3>
                <p>For the first time, I led a team, driving significant growth by scaling digital marketing channels and optimizing costs. I played a pivotal role in cross-functional collaborations between business and product teams. Expanding beyond my core responsibilities, I advised a subsidiary on digital advertising strategies and conducted in-depth business research for a new loyalty program. To balance work and wellness, I picked up boxing after hours.</p>

            <div class="card">
                <h3>2020: From ROI to Profitability</h3>
                <p>Transitioning from advertising to pricing strategy was a major leap—from optimizing traffic to maximizing profit margins. I gained exposure to merchandising, room rate strategies, and dynamic pricing, analyzing large datasets to develop impactful business cases that drove incremental revenue beyond traditional pricing scopes. During the pandemic, I launched a small kimchi business, handling both operations and marketing.</p>

                <h3>2022: The E-Commerce Era at NocNoc</h3>
                <p>I joined a fast-growing home and living e-commerce startup, applying my business and analytics expertise to drive strategic decision-making. I led initiatives that boosted sales, built fundamental business strategies, and contributed to making customers' dream homes a reality. Outside of work, I explored new food and coffee spots and practiced golf.</p>

                <h3>2024: The Measurement Partner Role at TikTok</h3>
                <p>Joining TikTok as a Measurement Partner, I help advertisers unlock the true value of their marketing investments through advanced measurement solutions, data-driven insights, and experimental design. I work closely with clients to interpret Brand Lift and Conversion Lift studies, providing strategic recommendations to optimize budget allocation, improve campaign performance, and drive business growth. Beyond work, I continue to explore new places, coffee, and food experiences while honing my skills in Pilates and golf.
